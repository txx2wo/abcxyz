          The most important position required for this project is definitely the game programmer. Like any IT projects,
          the programmer is the core of how to carry out the result of a project. In another word, the role of a game
          programmer oversees bringing the games to life. The programmers ’are in charge of programming all the
          interactions (game elements, artificial intelligence, networks) that the Game Designers have devised’ [2]. A
          game programmer is also someone who will create prototypes in the beginning of the project, troubleshoot and
          debug any issues. Hence, they will be responsible for ensuring the product to run without any bug or error.
          The game programmer will be writing codes to build the website mentioned, as well as mini games as part of our
          project.
          The individual selected for this position will need to possess a bachelor’s degree in IT or related field. The
          important qualifications needed for this job is the problem-solving skill, strong analytical frame of mind and
          must be proficient in programming languages. Finally, teamwork skill is also one of the crucial elements since
          the programmer will work in collaboration with game designer and other roles to create deliverables as well as
          set work deadlines. As technology has been evolving, so has programming. Therefore, we expect open-minded to
          innovative thinking and a fresh mind to new knowledge related to the field.

          It is without a doubt that we need a game designer for the complete product. The game designer position is
          described as a hybrid of graphic art and computer programming. Game artists do a range of jobs which have
          different responsibilities, skills, qualifications and experience needed; ‘while some designers work as
          writers, storyboarding and writing aspects of the game plot, dialogue, and other written components, other
          types of designers focus on the aesthetic and graphic aspects of a game’ [1]. Moreover, some game designers
          can also be programmers as they will handle interactive problems between the users and the game environment as
          well. Some argue that it depends on what type of games to have an art designer. Personally, regardless of the
          kind of gameplay, the purpose of concept art is to encapsulate thousands of tiny details and paint a picture
          of the intention. Hence, the end goal is to get each team members on the same page so that the decisions made
          are all moving the product in the same direction.
          As regards to our project, this position will take on the role of a web designer and a graphic designer, if
          any game is needed. Because our project’s mandatory priority is the website interface and then its variety of
          small games. A website's aesthetics plays a big role in catching the eyes’ attention. ‘Individuals looking to
          become game designers should have a background in both art and computer science’ [1]. Web designers need to be
          skilled in technical expertise to be able to deliver visually appealing websites, such as UX/UI and visual
          design.

          Before any releasement, we ought not to overlook the process of testing to make sure everything is
          operationally functioning. QA, which is short for Quality Assurance, is the person responsible for ensuring
          the quality of final project through provision of the working process between phases. QA jobs are to give the
          development process based on the specific requirements of each project; check and audit the execution of the
          process. Meanwhile, QC – Quality Control is the person responsible for performing the software quality check.
          The person will analyze the document which describes the system and design the test cases; write scripts for
          automation Test; coordinating with the programming team in fixing bugs and report details to project manager.
          In our project, this position will be in the shoes of testers, who will be checking the demo website and
          games.
          QA and QC both play vital and distinct roles hence why the position is important to our project. It is no
          doubt that having basic knowledge of IT and programming is the mandatory skill as a QA/QC. Secondly, specific
          domain knowledge is one of the professional skills required. The third is the knowledge of software systems
          and specialized QA. Additionally, good communication skill for teamwork, dedication and hardworking are also
          necessary traits. This is a very important position for the final of the project. Having a QA/QC will save
          time, money and resources.

      <dd>"I think our group is so great. Fortunately, I was able to work with great people who helped me a lot with
        this project. We work efficiently and everyone could do things in their forte, so although we worked from home
        most of the time, our work even went well. </dd>
      <dd>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to work from home because I can't go to Ho Chi Minh city
        soon. Therefore, I hope that in other classes, we could spend more time working with each other, and do our best
        to learn.</dd>
      <dd>My surprise was how much we learned in this class. It's important to study on our own during this project as
        well as in class. This will help us do our project the best. I think it's great because I can learn about things
        I didn't know before.</dd>
      <dd>What I learned from working in a group is how to get along with each other better. Everybody did their best
        to finish their own work, so we split the work up. If we looked at each person's strengths, then they could be
        given the jobs that are their favorite."</dd>

      <dt style="color:rgb(55, 115, 167); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 35px">Doanh:</dt>
      <dd>"Although I was the last member to arrive at the group, I felt fortunate to be here. Everyone is nice and
        dedicated to me, I got to learn many and many new things while working as a peer with them. Personally,
        regarding the previous assignment, I think the tasks were divided logically, and that we worked quite
        efficiently and on time prior to the deadline.</dd>
      <dd>Truthfully, the trouble I had struggled with was the technical side of each of our assignments, which we
        will be updating a website. I was very unfamiliar with how HTML and GitHub worked as I had had little to no
        background knowledge about this field before. I made quite a lot of mistakes working with GitHub at the early
        state of our assignment. I even accidentally merged the old codes once which caused our leader to re-write a few
        lines. However, thanks to my teammate, I am confident that I am better at maintaining it now.</dd>
      <dd>Working with the other team members enhanced my ability to perform and be responsible with the tasks
        assigned. I do really feel that I have learnt a ton from my teammates and from these assignments as well."</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt style="color:rgb(51, 105, 153); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 35px">Minh:</dt>
      <dd>"This is the first time I lead a group of newcomers so at first, I feel a little bit of overwhelming,
        however, since the early ages, I was interested in playing games with my friends, I feel bored when doing
        everything alone, therefore, I really enjoy working with people, especially, anyone that have related field as
        me, for example: IT.</dd>
      <dd>I managed to separate the works from the contents of our assignment step by step, what we should do with
        this part, who is going to do it, which parts need more people to deal with, and what the most important thing
        when doing the task, for the website, it is a little bit hard for my group, even though I have experienced in
        programming before, this is still the first time I have to learn about web development to finish our assignment.
        But I enjoyed every moment, it is good to know a very well-known aspect of IT, it is the world of world wide
        web, and learn how to design and deploy a website is very crucial, which will further my knowledge more.</dd>
      <dd>Everybody is a little bit confusing at the beginning, but it is fine, we are just new and first time working
        with each other, but at the end, everything turns out to be perfect. My team members managed to finish their
        tasks and they have already learnt and understood some of web development along the way, which will be a vital
        tool for them in the future, for myself, I enjoy the experience of leading a team, hosting meeting every week,
        divide the tasks equally among members considered their strength and weaknesses, moreover, ask my teammates to
        ask when they are in trouble, but at least, try to do some research first before asking.</dd>
      <dd>With this project, the most struggle thing is the game development using JS, I must do lots of research and
        how to connect and organize modules logically to easily assign tasks or manage the source code. But at the end,
        I understand more about how to organize the code base, not the best, I hope I will get better in the future.
        Moreover, it is quite tricky when designing the sticky side bar on the website, but I managed to finish it, I
        hope in the future, I can tackle and perfectly fixing the bugs and moreover, illustrate my knowledge to my team
        members as well."</dd>

      <dt style="color: rgb(55, 115, 167); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 35px">Kiet:</dt>
      <dd>"In my opinion, my group in general and my teammates are perfect. Together we created a nice working and
        studying environment, we are ready to help our teammates when someone have difficulty doing something by finding
        the trouble and think for the best way to solve it.</dd>
      <dd>Although our group must work from home, we don’t have the opportunity to meet face to face. I hope in the
        foreseeable future, we will have another chance to work together in other classes because we are congenial with
        each other’s.</dd>
      <dd>But what takes my impression is that the amount of knowledge that we learned in this course by completing
        the task that Minh assigned and together we build a perfect assignment by checking for the errors of the Word
        document and website by meeting via Microsoft Teams.</dd>
      <dd>My personal experience from this course that is we could know how to work as a team, working in a group
        environment. In addition, we also know we must be responsible for the task that the team captain assigned for
        each people to follow the group’s progress. By utilizing the Divide and Conquer strategy, we split the
        assignment into smaller pieces and then each people with different advantages could to their best job. I am
        really appreciating that I can work with this team, everybody makes me feel like I am with my family."</dd>
